## Overview

`prime-rl` chooses to use `vLLM` as the inference engine. We aim to stay up-to-date with the latest vLLM features, being at-most 1 version behind the latest stable release. This allows us to use the latest features from vLLM as soon as they are released - such as router replay, CPU KV cache offload, and more.

We support 3 distinct deployment shapes:
- [Single-Node](#single-node) - Runs the inference server on a single node. Useful for debugging, small scale experiments or smaller models. The default deployment shape.
- [Multi-Node](#multi-node) - Runs the inference server on multiple nodes. Useful for large scale experiments or larger models, where latency is not a concern - i.e. single turn inference, long context inference, etc.
- [Disaggregated](#disaggregated) - Runs the inference server on multiple nodes, but disaggregates the prefill and decode stages. Useful for large scale experiments or larger models, where latency is a concern and multi-node deployment creates very high E2E rollout latency, such as agentic workflows.

Most of the features are supported for all deployment shapes, with few exceptions. These exceptions are rejected on validation.

You can select the deployment shape with `InferenceDeploymentConfig` in your config file. This is a config-field that allows you to set the deployment shape, deployment-specific knobs such as `num_nodes`, `num_replicas`, `router_port`, `backend_port`, etc.

```toml
[inference.deployment]
type = "single_node" # or "multi_node" or "disaggregated"
```

To configure the inference server, you can use the `InferenceConfig` field. This is a config-field that allows you to set the inference server-specific knobs. Most of these are supported for all deployment shapes, with few exceptions. These exceptions are rejected on validation.

```toml
[inference]
model = "PrimeIntellect/INTELLECT-3"
...
```

We will now walk through the supported features and deployment shapes in detail, starting with the single-node deployment.

## Single-Node

The single-node deployment is the default deployment shape. It runs the inference server on a single node. It is useful for debugging, small scale experiments or smaller models. You can configure the single-node deployment with the `SingleNodeInferenceDeploymentConfig` config-field.

```toml
[inference.deployment]
type = "single_node"
```

This deployment shape runs the inference server on a single node, if configured with NVLink enabled, it allows you more freedom in terms of parallelism configurations.

```toml
[inference]
enable_expert_parallel = true # defaults to False

[inference.parallel]
tp = 2
dp = 4

[inference.deployment]
type = "single_node"
```

We reccomend choosing your parallelism based on the expected throughput and latency requirements. High `dp` might create high latency, however it will also give you the highest throughput. This is a tradeoff you need to make based on your use case and required `orchestrator.max_inflight_requests`. Setting `tp` to a higher value will usually give you lower latency, but the inference server also will become saturated faster with lower number of requests.

Another thing to consider, is the memory usage. You need to make sure that the model will fit into the available GPU memory. We will not go into the details on how to do this in this document. Related thing to consider, is the space for the KV cache. This will heavily affect the amount of requests your inference server can handle. You want to shard your model, either using `inference.enable_expert_parallel` or `inference.parallel.tp` to maximize the available GPU memory.

You can also increase the available KV cache memory by enabling `inference.kv_cache_offload`. More details in the [Advanced Configuration](#advanced-configuration) section.


## Multi-Node

This deployment shape branches into 2 sub-shapes:

- [Multi-replica](#multi-replica) - Runs the inference server on multiple nodes, but each node runs an independent vLLM replica. You can think of this as a for-loop over single-node deployments.
- [Wide-EP](#wide-ep) - This option is gated behind `inference.enable_expert_parallel = true`. It allows you to run the inference server on multiple nodes, allowing you to use multi-node expert parallelism. This is a more advanced feature that is suitable for high-throughput, high-concurrency workloads.

### Multi-replica

This deployment shape runs the inference server on multiple nodes, but each node runs an independent vLLM replica.
Parallelism configuration is the same as the single-node deployment. The shape is defined by setting `inference.deployment.type = "multi_node"` and `inference.deployment.num_nodes` to the number of nodes you want to run the inference server on.

```toml
[inference.deployment]
type = "multi_node"
num_nodes = 2

[inference]
model = "PrimeIntellect/INTELLECT-3"

[inference.parallel]
tp = 2
dp = 4
```

This configuration will run 2 independent vLLM replicas, each with `tp=2` and `dp=4`. Routing will be handled by the `vllm-router` instance running on the same node as the 1st replica. We aim to support more advanced routing options, such as `llm-d` or `dynamo` in the future. You can read more about the supported routing options in the [router](#router) section.

### Wide-EP

For huge, 200B+ scale models, you might want to use multi-node expert parallelism to maximize the KV-cache space. This deployment shape is defined by setting `inference.deployment.type = "multi_node"` and `inference.enable_expert_parallel = true`.

```toml
[inference.deployment]
type = "multi_node"
num_nodes = 2

[inference]
model = "PrimeIntellect/INTELLECT-3"
enable_expert_parallel = true

[inference.parallel]
tp = 2
dp = 8
```

This configuration will run 2 vLLM processes, each with `data_parallel_size_local = 4` and `tp = 2` and expert parallelism spanning 2 nodes. The requests are again routed to these processes via the `vllm-router`.

## P/D Dissagregation

This is the most advanced deployment shape. It allows you to disaggregate the prefill and decode stages, with KV cache flowing between them. This is useful for large scale deployments, where there are high requirements on latency, such as agentic workflows spanning 100s of turns.

This deployment shape is defined by setting `inference.deployment.type = "disaggregated"` and `inference.deployment.num_prefill_nodes` and `inference.deployment.num_decode_nodes` to the number of nodes you want to run the prefill and decode stages on.

```toml
[inference.deployment]
type = "disaggregated"
num_prefill_nodes = 2
num_decode_nodes = 2
```

Sometimes, you may want to run multiple independent vLLM instances within the prefill and decode node groups. You can do this by setting `inference.deployment.num_prefill_replicas` and `inference.deployment.num_decode_replicas` to the number of replicas you want to run.

```toml
[inference.deployment]
type = "disaggregated"
num_prefill_nodes = 2
num_decode_nodes = 2

num_prefill_replicas = 2
num_decode_replicas = 1
```

Now the total deployment will span 6 nodes - 2x2 for prefill and 1x2 for decode. 2 prefill replicas will run on 2 nodes each - total of 4 nodes for prefill. 1 decode replica will run on 2 nodes for decode.

We also allow you to configure the total amount of inference replicas - this is useful if you'd like to multiply the above configuration by a factor of `k`, each running behind a separate `vllm-router` instance.

```toml
[deployment] # this is a top-level RL deployment, not inference.deployment!!
type = "multi_node"
num_train_nodes = 4
num_infer_nodes = 6 # this is per-replica

num_infer_replicas = 3
```

This will run 3 inference replicas, each running on 6 nodes. Each replica will run on 2x2 nodes for prefill and 1x2 nodes for decode. The total deployment will span 18 nodes. This will also spin-up 3 separate `vllm-router` instances.


## Router

We use our own fork of [vllm-router](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/router) as the request handler. We plan to support more advanced proxy options in the future.

Right now, router handles 2 most important things:
- Request routing - KV cache re-use and balanced routing
- P/D disaggregation - handling the prefill and decode stages separately

### Routing policies
The 2 policies you might want to configure are:
- `consistent_hash` - this is the default policy that optimizes for KV cache re-use across turns - this works by hashing a request header to determine where to route the request to. You can configure what to hash by setting
`orchestrator.student.client.extra_headers_from_state` to the header the `router` expects to be set.

We set it to a sensible default, that works with all verifiers environments.

```toml
[orchestrator.student.client.extra_headers_from_state]
X-Session-ID = "trajectory_id" # this is the default - each rollout has a unique trajectory_id and router expects X-Session-ID
```

- `round_robin` - this policy will round-robin the requests between the available replicas. This is useful if you want to balance the load between the replicas. This might give you better results if you don't have enough rollouts to make `consistent_hash` hashing saturated.


## Advanced Configuration

### KV Cache Offload

Maximizing KV-Cache space is crucial to support high-concurrency workloads. You can offload the KV cache to CPU memory (and, behind it, disk) by setting `inference.kv_cache_offload`. It is a discriminated config with two composable tiers, `cpu` and `disk`: a `cpu` tier is always required, and an optional `disk` tier is layered behind it (GPU → DRAM → disk). Disk-only is not supported.

The `type` field selects the backend:

- `native` — vLLM's built-in offloading. CPU-only uses `OffloadingConnector`; CPU+disk uses `TieringOffloadingSpec` (a CPU primary tier with a filesystem secondary tier). Fully self-contained — no extra processes.
- `mooncake` — a [Mooncake](https://github.com/kvcache-ai/Mooncake) **shared distributed store** (SLURM only). One `mooncake_master` + metadata server runs on the head inference node; every inference node runs a `mooncake_client` that contributes its DRAM (and, with `disk`, SSD) segment to that *single* pool. Because blocks are keyed by model + parallel rank + content hash (no instance id), a prefix cached by one node/replica is reusable by all of them over RDMA — pooling every node's CPU RAM into one KV cache. Use `native` for local/single-process runs.

```toml
# Native CPU offload (reserves 128GB of CPU KV cache for this instance)
[inference.kv_cache_offload]
type = "native"
[inference.kv_cache_offload.cpu]
num_bytes = 128_000_000_000 # 128GB

# Native CPU + disk tiering (self-contained)
[inference.kv_cache_offload]
type = "native"
[inference.kv_cache_offload.cpu]
num_bytes = 128_000_000_000
[inference.kv_cache_offload.disk]
path = "/scratch/kv"        # disk capacity is bounded by the filesystem

# Mooncake CPU + disk (per-node distributed store, RDMA)
[inference.kv_cache_offload]
type = "mooncake"
[inference.kv_cache_offload.cpu]
num_bytes = 128_000_000_000
[inference.kv_cache_offload.disk]
path = "/scratch/kv"
```

For `native`, `cpu.num_bytes` is the aggregate CPU KV pool for the instance (vLLM shards it across workers). For `mooncake`, `cpu.num_bytes` is the DRAM each node contributes to the shared pool (so the total pool ≈ `num_bytes × #inference-nodes`); the store uses RDMA, so it requires an RDMA-capable fabric. Enabling offload automatically enables prefix caching.


### Optimized P/D disaggregation deployment

For optimal P/D disaggregation deployment, we automatically set the decode `all2all_backend` to `deepep_low_latency` and the prefill `all2all_backend` to `deepep_high_throughput`. We currently don't support customizing all2all backends for P/D disaggragation out of the box. You can do this by overriding the slurm template only.

For KV cache transfer, we utilize the NIXL connector. This is the default and only currently supported connector. We aim to support more advanced options, such as D->P transfer, or Mooncake Connector in the future.

For configuring various knobs with environment variables, we enable you to configure prefill and decode environment variables separately. This is useful if you want to configure different environment variables for the prefill and decode stages.

```toml
[inference.deployment]
type = "disaggregated"

prefill_env_overrides = {"VLLM_ENABLE_MOE_DP_CHUNK"="0", "VLLM_DEEP_GEMM_WARMUP"="skip"}
decode_env_overrides = {"VLLM_DEEP_GEMM_WARMUP"="skip"}
```

### Other vLLM features
We support various other vLLM features. Some of those, such as `enable_dbo`, `enable_eplb` are exposed as a top-level config fields. For those that are not, you can configure them by setting `inference.vllm_extra` to the desired value.

```toml
[inference.vllm_extra]
headless = true
```

### Finite-top-k sampled-logprob fast path

PrimeRL can opt into a narrow vLLM sampler fast path for rollout policies that
need only the sampled token's processed behavior-policy logprob. It avoids
vLLM's full-vocabulary processed-logprob tensor for the finite-top-k case:

```text
processed logits -> top-K slice -> top-p in K-space -> sample -> scalar logprob
```

Enable it only for workloads that match the current contract:

```text
logprobs_mode = processed_logprobs
max_num_logprobs is 0 or 1
no explicit logprob_token_ids
random sampling, not greedy
finite uniform top_k <= 64
uniform 0 < top_p <= 1
no per-request RNG generators
CUDA logits
```

The path is default-off and version-guarded. It currently supports the pinned
vLLM and FlashInfer versions in the PrimeRL runtime. If either version drifts,
the patch raises during vLLM startup so the run does not silently use an
unvalidated kernel path.

Operator knobs:

```bash
export PRIME_RL_ENABLE_FINITE_TOPK_SAMPLED_LOGPROB=1
export PRIME_RL_FINITE_TOPK_SAMPLED_LOGPROB_TAIL=triton
export PRIME_RL_FINITE_TOPK_SAMPLED_LOGPROB_DENSE_PRESENCE=1
export PRIME_RL_FINITE_TOPK_SAMPLED_LOGPROB_STATS_INTERVAL=1000
export PRIME_RL_LOG_FINITE_TOPK_SAMPLED_LOGPROB_FALLBACK=1
```

Optional warmup/JIT probe knobs:

```bash
export PRIME_RL_FINITE_TOPK_SAMPLED_LOGPROB_PRECOMPILE_TAIL=1
export PRIME_RL_FINITE_TOPK_SAMPLED_LOGPROB_PRECOMPILE_TOP_K=20
export PRIME_RL_FINITE_TOPK_SAMPLED_LOGPROB_PRECOMPILE_TOP_P=0.95
export PRIME_RL_FINITE_TOPK_SAMPLED_LOGPROB_PRECOMPILE_VOCAB=248320
export PRIME_RL_FINITE_TOPK_SAMPLED_LOGPROB_PRECOMPILE_BATCHES=1,128,256
```

The precompile knob is default-off and experimental. It calls the patched
Triton K-tail at `Sampler` construction time. It is useful as a warmup/JIT
diagnostic, but it is not a proven way to eliminate first-traffic sampler-tail
JIT. Production-shaped probes showed that batch-1-only warmup was insufficient,
and that even warming the first observed learner batch shapes did not eliminate
all post-ready `_k_tail_uniform_kernel` JIT. It also does not cover unrelated
vLLM/MoE/LoRA kernels.

Set `PRIME_RL_ENABLE_FINITE_TOPK_SAMPLED_LOGPROB=0` or unset it to disable the
path. The older `PRIME_RL_ENABLE_FLASHINFER_SAMPLED_LOGPROB` and
`PRIME_RL_FLASHINFER_SAMPLER_*` names are compatibility aliases for existing
experiment launchers.

Fallback is automatic for unsupported request shapes, including explicit
`logprob_token_ids`, `max_num_logprobs` outside `{0, 1}`, mixed `top_k`/`top_p`,
`top_k` larger than 64, greedy rows, per-request generators, non-CUDA logits,
and non-processed-logprob modes. With stats enabled, vLLM logs fast/fallback
call counts, row hit rate, batch-size buckets, and fallback reasons. Multi-node
launches also write JSONL sidecars under `logs/inference/` named
`finite_topk_sampler_stats_*.jsonl`; use `learner_row_hit_rate` and
`fallback_reason_by_traffic` there when separating learner traffic from
vLLM warmup/profiling calls.

### Router Replay

Router replay works by capturing the expert routing decisions into a buffer. This buffer then gets sent to the trainer, which can use it instead of re-computing the routing. This lowers the trainer↔inference mismatch by an order of magnitude, resulting in more stable training.

To enable router replay, you can set `inference.enable_return_routed_experts = true`.

```toml
[trainer]
enable_router_replay = true # this will also auto-set the inference.enable_return_routed_experts = true

[inference]
enable_return_routed_experts = true
```

This however is not free, it adds a significant overhead to the HTTP requests as this payload can grow quite large. We reccomend increasing `orchestrator.*.env.num_workers` to allow for more parallelization on the verifiers side.

Currently this feature is also not supported with CPU KV cache offload, which can have negative impact on the inference throughput.
