"""Schedule-aware turn alignment — the protocol structure, generalized.

A *schedule* is the expected sequence of turn-slots an interaction protocol
produces. It is regime-generic:

  - single_turn            : one slot.
  - single_agent_multiturn : a loop of the lone actor (e.g. model→tool→model…),
                             length = the run's modal turn count.
  - multi_agent            : the seat/phase order (e.g. debate [a,b,a,b,judge]).

Observed ``Episode`` steps are aligned to the schedule so the timeline can show
actual-vs-expected — ``matched`` / ``truncated`` (expected slot, no step) /
``extra`` (step beyond schedule) / ``deviated`` (actor mismatch) — for ANY regime.
Debate is one instance, not a special case.

The "expected" schedule is inferred at the **run** level: the canonical (modal)
turn pattern across a run's episodes. An individual episode then aligns to it, so
a short rollout reads as *truncated relative to its run*, not just "5 turns". When
a run config that defines the protocol is available it should override the
inference (``source="config"``); v1 infers (``source="inferred"``).
