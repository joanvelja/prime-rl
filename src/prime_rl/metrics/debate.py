"""Tier-2 debate metric aggregator.

Consumes rollout primitives emitted by verifiers' ``DebateRubric``
(``first_answer/{member}``, ``final_answer/{member}``, ``flipped/{member}``,
per-member rewards, MAR episode_categorical winner) and produces
per-training-step scalars for W&B + a sidecar JSONL.

Scope: what survives without judge logprobs. Calibration (Brier,
Reliability, Resolution) is tracked separately and requires a
logprob-capable judge backend (see joanvelja/verifiers#5).

Design: one pure function ``compute_step_metrics`` for aggregation,
plus ``write_step_metrics`` for the fire-and-forget write path. The
orchestrator calls ``write_step_metrics`` once per ``save_rollouts``
site. Debate-specific: skips rollouts where the env isn't a debate env
(no ``winner`` in ``mar_score.episode_categorical``).
