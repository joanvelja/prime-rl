"""Role-conditioned advantage estimation for multi-agent training.

Rank-7 RAE: shrunk leave-one-out + historical prior, with the antithetic
merge for zero-sum member pairs. For a finalized group of G episodes
sharing key ``(env_name, example_id)``, each episode contributing a
zero-sum pair with canonical reward ``r_i``::

    A_i = r_i - [lam * b + (1 - lam) * loo_mean_i]
    lam = n_eff / (n_eff + G - 1)        (lam = 1 when G = 1)

where ``b`` is the persistent per-key baseline and ``loo_mean_i`` is the
mean of the *other* episodes' canonical rewards. The non-canonical member
gets ``-A_i``. The baseline folds once per group close::

    b <- beta * b + (1 - beta) * group_mean

Order-invariant by construction: every episode subtracts the same
pre-group baseline, and the fold happens after all advantages are set.

The baseline frame is derived from the UNFILTERED zero-sum pair
(``extract_episode_pairs_for_multi_agent``, fed by each episode's
``mar_score``), never from the trainability-filtered member rows: under
``train_one`` a whole group can collapse to a single seat, and a
present-set-derived frame would fold the persistent baseline with a
flipped sign. The canonical member id is persisted per key in
``RAEState.canonical_members``; a group whose full pair would change the
frame fails loud.
