description: Run multi_node RL inside an already-held Slurm allocation (no sbatch) on Isambard-AI, and split one allocation into several concurrent runs ("lanes"). Use when launching training/eval from inside an allocation, when a multi_node run hangs before inference becomes reachable, when inference dies with "vllm-router: command not found", or when concurrent runs clobber each other's outputs.

# In-allocation multi_node launch

On Isambard-AI you hold a Slurm allocation as a **node pool** and run `rl` **inside** it. `rl` is the orchestrator: it `srun`s the trainer and inference onto the allocation's nodes itself. You do **not** wrap it in `srun` or `sbatch`.

A config runs in-allocation **iff it has no `[slurm]` block**. With a `[slurm]` block the same config submits a fresh `sbatch` job instead — use that only when you do *not* already hold nodes.

## Single run

```bash
# 1. Hold the pool (from the login node). Drops you into a shell INSIDE the allocation.
launch-script-mnode 4

# 2. Bind that shell to this checkout. The allocation shell usually pre-loads
#    the Prime-RL environment; source the setup script only if `uv`/fabric env
#    vars are missing in the shell you landed in.
cd "$PROJECTDIR"/joanv.a6r/work/prime-rl-main
# source scripts/env/activate-prime-rl.sh

# 3. Export repo .env values so W&B/cache/API variables propagate through uv and
#    nested srun children.
set -a
source .env
set +a

# 4. Launch — plainly. No srun, no sbatch.
uv run --no-sync rl @ configs/isambard/rl_2node_inalloc.toml
```

With no `--deployment.hosts`, the whole allocation is treated as one run. Topology comes from the config (`num_train_nodes`, `num_infer_nodes`, `gpus_per_node = 4`).

## GH200 GPU env repair

For a broken GPU CI env on AIP2, repair the project env through the same CUDA
13.1 path that `launch-script-mnode` / `cc-wrapper-mnode` uses: source
`/lus/lfs1aip2/projects/a6r/joanv.a6r/scripts/primerl_env.sh`, set
`UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=.venv-ci-gpu`, then run
`bash scripts/sync-prime-rl-env.sh`. Do not bypass `exclude-newer` or
hand-install a replacement torch stack.

The sync wrapper keeps `uv sync` exact while preserving the GH200 accelerator
invariant: ordinary syncs refuse accidental `flash-attn` source rebuilds, FA4 is
repaired after any namespace clobber, and the wrapper verifies FA2/FA3/FA4
imports before it exits. If FA2 really must be rebuilt, run the wrapper on a
compute node with `PRIME_RL_ALLOW_FLASH_ATTN_BUILD=1`; do not let login-node or
ordinary dependency-sync paths compile it implicitly. Validation commands after
that should still use `uv run --no-sync ...` so interactive probes do not
implicitly resync the environment mid-run.

## Concurrent runs ("lanes")

Split the pool into disjoint slices, one full run on each. A lane needs **exactly** `num_train_nodes + num_infer_nodes` nodes (the config's own topology). Each lane needs a disjoint host slice, a distinct `--deployment.port-base` (≥100 apart), and a distinct `--deployment.lane-tag`:

```bash
mapfile -t n < <(scontrol show hostnames "$SLURM_JOB_NODELIST")
uv run --no-sync rl @ configs/isambard/rl_2node_inalloc.toml \
  --deployment.hosts "${n[0]},${n[1]}" --deployment.port-base 29500 --deployment.lane-tag "$SLURM_JOB_ID-l0" &
uv run --no-sync rl @ configs/isambard/rl_2node_inalloc.toml \
  --deployment.hosts "${n[2]},${n[3]}" --deployment.port-base 29700 --deployment.lane-tag "$SLURM_JOB_ID-l1" &
wait
```

You pick the *shape* by picking the config: a 2-node config on a 32-node hold makes 16 lanes; an 8-node config on the same hold makes 4. See [`docs/launch.md`](../../docs/launch.md) for the full command surface and [`docs/scaling.md`](../../docs/scaling.md) for the pool model.

## Pitfalls (these bite consistently)

1. **Run `rl` plainly — never under `srun`/`sbatch`.** Inside an allocation `rl` *is* the head-node orchestrator and fans out via its own internal `srun --exact`. An outer `srun` nests step creation and **deadlocks**.
2. **In-alloc requires NO `[slurm]` block in the config.** A `[slurm]` block silently switches to the sbatch-submit path — wrong when you already hold nodes.
3. **`gpus_per_node = 4` on AIP2** (4 GH200/node). Upstream configs default to 8; leaving 8 breaks the GPU math.
4. **Set `weight_broadcast.type = "nccl"` for full-weight non-LoRA runs.** It moves weights GPU→GPU over Slingshot (~10× faster than the `filesystem` default, which round-trips a checkpoint through Lustre). For LoRA science runs, use `filesystem` unless you are explicitly testing NCCL adapter broadcast: filesystem uses vLLM's adapter load lifecycle and avoids the serving-engine pause/drain collective contract.
5. **Concurrent lanes must be fully disjoint:** distinct node slices, `port-base` ≥100 apart, distinct `lane-tag`. The `lane-tag` namespaces outputs/rollouts/caches; omit or repeat it and lanes overwrite each other's rollouts and one crashes (`FileNotFoundError` on `rollouts/step_N`).
6. **The `vllm-router` aarch64 wheel must be in `uv.lock`.** If multi_node inference dies with `vllm-router: command not found`, the lock is missing the `manylinux_2_28_aarch64` router wheel. `pyproject.toml` pins both-arch wheels; after any pyproject change run `uv lock` **and commit the lock** — committing the manifest without its lock is the trap.
7. **Use `scripts/sync-prime-rl-env.sh` for GH200 syncs.** Raw `uv sync` can leave the FA2/FA4 namespace invalid on aarch64 — and once uv's build cache is pruned it insists on a full nvcc rebuild of flash-attn just to reconcile the lock. The wrapper excludes flash-attn from the locked sync, restores the locked version from `PRIME_RL_WHEELHOUSE` (default `./wheels`; on Isambard symlink that to `"$PROJECTDIR"/joanv.a6r/wheels`, which carries the pre-built aarch64 wheel), repairs FA4 clobbering, and verifies FA2/FA3/FA4 imports before returning. Use `PRIME_RL_ALLOW_FLASH_ATTN_BUILD=1` only for an intentional compute-node rebuild.
8. **Generated lane component commands must use `uv run --no-sync`.** Plain inner `uv run inference` / `orchestrator` / `torchrun` can resync a shared `.venv` concurrently across nodes; symptoms include transient missing CUDA libraries such as `libcusparseLt.so.0`.
9. **Export `.env` before launching `rl`.** Bare assignments loaded by `source .env` are shell variables, not inherited environment variables. Use `set -a; source .env; set +a` so `WANDB_API_KEY`, cache roots, and API keys reach `uv run` and nested `srun` children.
10. **Stagger large inference fanout if vLLM startup livelocks.** Set `INFERENCE_START_STAGGER_SECONDS=30` before `rl` to delay inference node `N` by `N*30s`; default is 0. This preserves CUDA graph mode and avoids simultaneous 7-node vLLM startup pressure.
11. **Slingshot is libfabric (`cxi`), not InfiniBand.** Never use `ibv_devinfo` / `NCCL_IB_HCA`. The fabric loads via `module load brics/nccl`; without it NCCL silently falls back to TCP sockets (~10× slower). A healthy fabric does ≥~23 GB/s on `nccl-tests` and prints `NET/OFI` in `NCCL_DEBUG=INFO`.
12. **`/tmp` and `/dev/shm` are a shared, RAM-backed tmpfs that Slurm does NOT wipe between jobs.** A lane can hit `OSError [Errno 28] ENOSPC` from *other users'* leftover caches on a node — an environment issue, not a launcher bug. Pick fresh nodes or clear space; don't chase it as a code bug.
